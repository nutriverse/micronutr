Description: Vitamin and mineral deficiencies continue to be a significant 
    public health problem. This is particularly critical in developing countries
    where deficiencies to vitamin A, iron, iodine, and other micronutrients
    lead to adverse health consequences. Cross-sectional surveys are helpful in
    answering questions related to the magnitude and distribution of
    deficiencies of selected vitamins and minerals. This package provides tools
    for calculating and determining select vitamin and mineral deficiencies
    using R.
