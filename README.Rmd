Vitamin and mineral deficiencies continue to be a significant public health problem. This is particularly critical in developing countries where deficiencies to vitamin A, iron, iodine, and other micronutrients lead to adverse health consequences. Cross-sectional surveys are helpful in answering questions related to the magnitude and distribution of deficiencies of selected vitamins and minerals.

## Installation

You can install `micronutr` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```{r install-cran, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("micronutr")
```

You can install the development version of `micronutr` from [nutriverse r-universe](https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev) with:

```{r install-r-universe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "micronutr", 
  repos = c('https://nutriverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

## What does `micronutr` do?

The `micronutr` package provides tools for determining select vitamin and mineral deficiencies using R. Currently, `micronutr` has functions for:

* Detecting **haemoglobinaemia** or anaemia based on an individual's *serum haemoglobin* level;

* Detecting **inflammation** status based on *c-reactive protein (CRP)* and *alpha(1)-acid-glycoprotein (AGP)*;

* Detecting **iron deficiency** status based on an individual's *serum ferritin* level;

* Detecting **iodine deficiency** status based on a population's mean urinary iodine concentration.

## Usage

`micronutr` comes packaged with vignettes that show how to use the package for the purposes described above.

* [Detecting **haemoglobinaemia**](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr/articles/haemoglobinaemia.html)

* [Detecting **inflammation**](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr/articles/inflammation.html)

* [Detecting **iron deficiency**](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr/articles/iron-deficiency.html)

* [Detecting **iodine deficiency**](https://nutriverse.io/micronutr/articles/iodine-deficiency.html)

## Citation

If you find the `micronutr` package useful, please cite using the suggested citation provided by a call to the `citation` function as follows:

```{r citation, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
citation("micronutr")
```
